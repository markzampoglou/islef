***************
* Description *
***************  

this directory contains a Matlab implementation of an
algorithm used to detect the presence of DCT quantization
artifacts, as decribed in Ye, Shuiming, Qibin Sun, and Ee-Chien Chang. 
"Detecting digital image forgeries by measuring inconsistencies of blocking 
artifact." In Multimedia and Expo, 2007 IEEE International Conference on, 
pp. 12-15. IEEE, 2007.

If you use the code for academic purposes, you should 
cite the aforementioned work.

A demo script and a sample image are included.

************
* Platform *
************      

Written and tested on Matlab 8.3.0.532 (R2014a) 
It is likely that it will work on older versions.
