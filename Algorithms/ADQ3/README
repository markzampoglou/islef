***************
* Description *
***************  

this archive includes a Matlab implementation of an
algorithm used to detect the presence of aligned double
JPEG compression, as decribed in Amerini, Irene, Rudy Becarelli, Roberto 
Caldelli, and Andrea Del Mastio. "Splicing forgeries localization through 
the use of first digit features." In Information Forensics and Security 
(WIFS), 2014 IEEE International Workshop on, pp. 143-148. IEEE, 2014.

If you use the code for academic purposes, you should 
cite the aforementioned work.

A demo script and a sample image are included.

************
* Platform *
************      

Written and tested on Matlab 8.3.0.532 (R2014a) 
It is likely that it will work on older versions.

***********************
* Set-up Instructions *  
***********************

extract all files to a single directory. Add the directory to the Matlab path, 
or set it as the current Matlab directory


********************
* Run Instructions *
********************      

run demo.m from Matlab prompt


**********************
* Output Description *
**********************

the demo shows each image together with computed IPM nd DIPM. Min-entropy 
values for both IPM and DIPM are given. For each image it is said whether 
non-aligned JPEG compression is detected or not, according to predefined 
thresholds. If NA-JPEG is detected, the estimated grid shift and quantization 
step of DC coefficients of primary compression are reported.
